Hello, everyone! 👋

I'm Filippo Brajucha, a 23-year-old computer science enthusiast with a passion for all things tech and programming. 🖥️

I've earned a bachelor's degree in computer science and management, and my experience in this realm has been incredibly exciting.📚

I had the incredible opportunity to kickstart my career [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/ie-en) in Dublin and at [Ascom Confcommercio](https://www.confcommercioimola.it/) at Imola, where I learned more interesting things about the tech industry.👨🏻‍💻

Currently, I'm pursuing my master's degree in CS and management at the [University of Bologna](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/ComputerScience).
This program is providing me with the advanced knowledge and abilities needed to address the intricate challenges of the digital era.

I'm passionate about both frontend and backend development. I find joy in crafting lovely user experiences but I also like to create innovative solutions and solving problems as a true backend developer.

In the last period I developed a strong passion for Artificial Intelligence.

Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities of technology together! Feel free to reach out and connect. 🚀
